AOM vs BOM vs DOM

### AOM
The Accessibility Object Model (AOM) is a JavaScript API project by the W3C that aims to improve the experience of using assistive technology devices on the web.

### BOM
BOM stands for Browser Object Model, which is a collection of objects that a web browser exposes. The BOM is used to manipulate properties and methods of the browser itself, and allows JavaScript to interact with the browser window, document, and other browser-specific functionalities.

### DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure and content of a web document as nodes and objects.
