# Type Script

Type script is used to build a script for a JS, Devloper feel to building the logic in the JS is little hard, 
so the Typescript is builded by the Mirosoft,Once the code done in the Type Script then we need to convert that code to
Java Script.


Install Typescript in Node JS.

  - Before that, make sure node js in installed.

  ``` npm install --save-dev typescript ```

  To Check the Versoin

  ``` tsc --version ```

To convert that we need to install 

``` npm install -g ts-node ```


 - In the Ts the file end with .ts
 - then the .ts file will convert as a .js file.
 - if we run the ```tsc`` with in the project folder all the .ts files with in the folder converted to .js file.
 - if we use the ``` ts-node <file_name>.ts ```, it will not convet, i will run the code and excute the output.
