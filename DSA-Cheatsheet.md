### Linear Data Structure
 - where the data is arranged sequentially, each element attached with they perivious and next element.
 - **Ex**. Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.
 
 #### Static Data Structure
 - Static Data structure have fixed memoery size, easier to access the element.
 - **EX**. Array
 #### Dynamic Data Structure
 - In the dynamic data structure the size is not fixed, It can be randomly updated during the runtime.
 - **EX**. queue, stack, Linked list, etc
